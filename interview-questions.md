# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: A conditional statement evaluates whether a specific block of code can be executed or not if a condition is either true or false. These are mostly used in if/else statements.

  Researched answer: Conditional statements is used for handling and evaluating decisions and is used to perform different actions based on specific conditions.



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is the ability to work on a specific project/file while being able to make changes, edit, and collaborate with your team or partner. It allows yourself and other people who are also working on the same project to make changes on the file and eventually merge it with the original project. While github is a resource online where everyone can showcase their code and projects they are currently working on. You are able to upload your repositories to this source and allow other people to see if set to public. It is also helpful to upload your work to this resource in case your files gets deleted or your computer somehow crashes and you're not able to retrieve any of your work. You will be able to view and download all your work through github.

  Researched answer: Git is the process that allows you to create repositories, make changes to them, and tracks a history of the work that's done to a file. It is used to make collaboration with your team easier and allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time and merge it all together into one source. It is installed and maintained on your local computer rather than remotely. While github is a repository hosting service and files are stored via cloud-based and can be accessed remotely. You are able to share, and view your code with others and also have the ability to make changes and revisions to your teams project through different branches. Different branches are like different versions of each others work and no changes will be done to the main project unless your team decides to push/pull the changes at the end.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Boolean values are primitive data types that returns a of true or false. There are 3 types of boolean operators. First are relational operators which includes "<, >, <=, and >=". There is also logical operators which includes "&& and ||" which also returns either true or false. The other 2 operators used to return boolean values are "==" which is loosely equality and "===" which is strictly equality. It is more common practice to use strictly equality when comparing 2 or more values of data to get the most accurate result.

  Researched answer: There are a variety of operators used to return boolean values in programming. Relational and logical operators. Relational operators evaluates the difference between 2 or more data types to see if its true or false. While the logical operator evaluates 2 or more statements to see if 1 value AND another value is true/false or to see if 1 value OR another value is true or false.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index refers to a number or position of an element or value. In JavaScript, the very first character or element always starts at 0 index instead of 1. For example, the string "HELLO WORLD" 0 index would be "H", index 1 would be "E", index 2 would be "L" and so on. Values are data types that are assigned within variables. For example: ---> var yourName = "Jose", in this case the string "Jose" is the value that is assigned to the variable.

  Researched answer: An index is a property that contains a specific position/location within a regular expression. It is a numerical representation of an item's location. In most programming languages, indexes starts at the index of 0 instead of 1. A value is a data that is a definite object. It could be numbers, letters, and characters. In programming, values are usually stored inside a variable, so they could be accessed at any time.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the process of repeating a list of steps or instructions that is usually used in a loop. It is when the same procedure is repeated multiple times over and over again until a condition is met or as long as that condition is true.

  Researched answer: Iteration is a repetition of a process in programming, usually done in 3 different loops, which are for loop, while loop, do-while loop. It also refers to a sequence of steps that is being repeated until an end result is met.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There are 2 roles in pair programming, first person is the driver and the other is the navigator. The driver's main role is to be the one that is hands on and the one actually typing the code. While the navigator is the one guiding and giving detailed information about what to code. At the same time, these two are communicating with each other by brainstorming, and  coming up with different ideas and ways to solve a problem. The purpose of this is to collaborate and share ideas as well as to teach each other something valuable that they don't know during this process. It is best practice to switch from driver to navigator and vice verse after 30mins or so to be able to experience the different roles. This technique is frequently used in this industry and helps build collaboration within the team.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique where 2 or more programmers work together, one being the driver and the other being the navigator. The driver is the one writing the code while the other is the one navigating through the code, ensuring there are no spelling or syntax errors. Both drivers and navigator are working side by side to problem solve, catch errors, coming up with different ideas on how to solve a problem. This technique allows team members to share information with each other, communicate more proficient while working on a project, and it improves the productivity than working solo. It is also another way to become more proficient in programming especially if paired with someone more experienced and skilled.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: it is a function that accept functions as parameters and returns a function.

2. Jest: it is a testing framework designed to ensure the accuracy of any javascript codebase.

3. Objects: it is an entity that contains properties and type. Objects are similar to variables but it can contain more values than a normal variable.

4. Method: it is an action that can be performed on objects and is a property containing a function definition.

5. Classes: it is a template for creating objects. You can declare a class by using the keyword "class" followed by a name in pascal case.
